# Online Shopper Intention - Data Analysis and Machine Learning

## Introduction

When it comes to shopping, most people prefer online shopping. Many people visit e-commerce sites daily with the intention to purchase or simply browse. Various reasons and factors influence these intentions. This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in Python on e-commerce shopping intentions and applies both supervised and unsupervised learning models to predict shopper behavior and revenue.

## Project Overview

- **Objective**: Analyze online shopper behavior and predict revenue using machine learning models.
- **Tools Used**: Python, Pandas, scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib.
- **Models Used**:
  - Supervised Learning: Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Gaussian Na√Øve Bayes (GNB)
  - Unsupervised Learning: K-means Clustering

## Key Results

- **Supervised Learning**:
  - SVM achieved an accuracy of 84.06%
  - GNB achieved an accuracy of 79.60%
- **Unsupervised Learning**:
  - K-means Clustering achieved a Silhouette Score of 0.7


## How to Use

1. **Clone the repository**:
